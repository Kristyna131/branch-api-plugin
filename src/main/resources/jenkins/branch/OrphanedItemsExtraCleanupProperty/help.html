        Cleanup of orphaned items are normally only done during a full scan of the multibranch project.
        SCM events can mark a branch project as "dead" if for example a branch is deleted in the scm,
        but will only be removed when the full scan is performed for various reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
        This provides a separate cleanup process of "dead" branch projects that doesn't perform a full scan and doesn't consult the scm and so doesn't suffer from api rate limits et.al.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>WARNING: </strong> Cleaning up orphaned items should normally be left to a full scan as that is the only time Jenkins has all the relevant information to reliably perform a cleaning.
        Using this setting could result in unwanted behavior if the timing is not in your favor. This should only be used if you can't run a full scan frequently enough and trust your scm events enough.
    </p>
